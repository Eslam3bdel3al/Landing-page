## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

# OK my work
now I am done
* create the navbar that dynamically will contain a list of the document sections.
* the navbar is hidden untill the button on the left-top of the page is clicked.
* when you click a section from the navbar the window will scroll to it and it will be highlighted then the navbar disappear.
* when you open the navbar without clicking any section it will disappear when you scroll to give you clear view.
* the section that you wheel through will be highlighted.

# Resubmission 
I have
* made the scroll to the section easy as you suggested by using "behavior: 'smooth' ".
* made the section li in the navbar to be highlighted too when been selected.
* used getBoundingClientRect() method to highlight the section while scrolling and to hightlight it in the navbar too.
